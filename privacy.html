        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 13, 2026</p>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Neon Dash</strong>. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we handle information and data security when you play our game.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect and Share</h2>
        <p>Neon Dash does not require any account registration or personal login. However, we use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> and standard analytics to function. The following data is collected and shared with third-party service providers for advertising and performance monitoring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We share your Android Advertising ID with AdMob to serve relevant advertisements.</li>
            <li><strong>Approximate Location:</strong> We use IP addresses to determine your general location (City/Country) to provide ads in the correct language.</li>
            <li><strong>App Activity:</strong> We track game interactions (like high scores and button clicks) to improve gameplay and monitor ad performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> We collect <strong>Crash Logs</strong> and <strong>Diagnostics</strong> to identify bugs and ensure the game runs smoothly on all devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Security and Encryption</h2>
        <p>We take your data security seriously. All data collected and shared with third-party partners is <strong>encrypted in transit</strong> using secure protocols (HTTPS). This ensures that your technical identifiers remain protected while being processed.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
        <p>This app uses Google AdMob. AdMob may use your information to personalize the ads you see. You can opt-out of personalized advertising at any time through your Android device's "Google Settings > Ads" menu.</p>
        <p>For more details, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy & Terms</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. Local Storage</h2>
        <p>Your game progress, such as your "Best Score" and "Mute Preferences," is stored directly on your device using <strong>Local Storage</strong>. This data is not transmitted to our servers and can be cleared by deleting the app's cache or uninstalling the game.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Neon Dash is a general audience game. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact us immediately.</p>
